### 10. Anti-Fighter Barrage (Unit Ability)

A unit with the “Anti-Fighter Barrage” ability may be able to destroy an opponent’s fighters at the onset of a battle. During the “Anti-Fighter Barrage” step of the first round of space combat, players perform the following steps:

10.1. STEP 1 — Each player rolls dice for each of their units in thecombat that has the “Anti-Fighter Barrage” ability; this is called an anti-fighter barrage roll. A hit is produced for each die roll that is equal to or greater than the unit’s anti-fighter barrage value.
* If a unit has an “Anti-Fighter Barrage” ability, it is presented on its faction sheet and technology cards.
* The “Anti-Fighter Barrage” ability is displayed as “Anti-Fighter Barrage X (Y).” The X is the minimum value needed for a die to produce a hit, and Y is the number of dice rolled.
* Game effects that reroll, modify, or otherwise affect combat rolls do not affect anti-fighter barrage rolls
* This ability can still be used if no fighters are present; hits produced may be used to trigger specific abilities.

10.2. STEP 2 — Each player must choose and destroy one of their fighters in the active system for each hit their opponent’s antifighter barrage roll produced.
* If a player has to assign more hits than they have fighters in the active system, the excess hits have no effect.

### 15. Bombardment
A unit with the “Bombardment” ability may be able to destroy another player’s ground forces during an invasion. During the “Bombardment” step of an invasion, players perform the following steps:

15.1. STEP 1 — The active player chooses which planet each of their units that has a “Bombardment” ability will bombard. Then, that player rolls dice for each of those units; this is called a bombardment roll. A hit is produced for each die roll that is equal to or greater than the unit’s “Bombardment” value.
* If a unit has a “Bombardment” ability, it is presented on its faction sheet and technology cards.
* The “Bombardment” ability is displayed as “Bombardment X (Y).” The X is the minimum value needed for a die to produce a hit, and Y is the number of dice rolled. Not all “Bombardment” abilities have a (Y) value; a bombardment roll for such a unit consists of one die.
* Game effects that reroll, modify, or otherwise affect combat rolls do not affect bombardment rolls.
* Multiple planets in a system may be bombarded, but a player must declare which planet a unit is bombarding before making a bombardment roll.
* The L1Z1X’s “Harrow” ability does not affect the L1Z1X player’s own ground forces.
* Planets that contain a unit with the “Planetary Shield” ability cannot be bombarded.

15.2. STEP 2 — The player who controls the planet that is being bombarded chooses and destroys one of their ground forces on that planet for each hit result the bombardment roll produced.
* If a player has to assign more hits than that player has ground forces, the excess hits have no effect.

### 30. Deploy
Some units have deploy abilities. Deploy abilities are indicated by the “Deploy” header and provide the means to place specific units on the game board without producing them as normal.

30.1. A player can use a unit’s deploy ability when the ability’s conditions are met to place that unit on the game board.
* A player does not have to spend resources to deploy a unit unless otherwise specified.

30.2. A player can only resolve a deploy ability to place a unit that is in their reinforcements.
* If there are no units that have a deploy ability in a player’s reinforcements, the deploy ability cannot be used.

30.3. A unit’s deploy ability can be resolved only once per timing window.

### 65. Planetary Shield
Units cannot use the “Bombardment” ability against a planet that contains a unit that has the “Planetary Shield” ability.

65.1. The “Planetary Shield” ability does not prevent a planet from being affected by the “X-89 Bacterial Weapon” technology.

65.2. The “Planetary Shield” ability prevents an L1Z1X player from using their “Harrow” faction ability.

65.3. If a war sun is in a system with any number of other players’ units that have the “Planetary Shield” ability, those units are treated as if they do not have that ability.
* Units treated as if they do not have a “Planetary Shield” ability cannot use the “Magen Defense Grid” technology.
* A war sun can use its “Bombardment” ability against planets that contain units that have the “Planetary Shield” ability.

### 68. Production
During the “Production” step of a tactical action, the active player can resolve the “Production” ability of each of their units that are in the active system to produce units.

68.1. A unit’s “Production” ability on its faction sheet is always followed by a value. This value is the maximum number of units that this unit can produce.
* If the active player has multiple units in the active system that have the “Production” ability, that player can produce a number of units up to the combined total of their units’ production values in that system.
* When producing fighters or infantry, each individual unit counts toward the producing unit’s production limit.
* A player can choose to produce one fighter or infantry instead of two, but must still pay the entire cost.
* “Production” value from Arborec space docks cannot be used to produce infantry, even if the Arborec player controls other units with “Production” in the same system.

68.2. When a player produces ships by using “Production,” that player must place them in the active system.

68.3. When a player produces ground forces, that player must place those unit on planets that contain a unit that used its “Production” ability.

68.4. If a player uses the “Production” ability of a unit in a space area of a system to produce ground forces, those ground forces may either be placed on a planet the player controls in that system or in the space area of that system.
* If a player places a ground force in the space area of a system, it cannot exceed that player’s capacity in that system.

### 77. Space Cannon
A unit that has the “Space Cannon” ability can use it during two different steps of a player’s tactical action: after the “Move Ships” substep (Space Cannon Offense) and during an invasion (Space Cannon Defense).

77.1. A player is not required to be the active player to use their “Space Cannon” ability of their units.

77.2. SPACE CANNON OFFENSE
During a tactical action, after the “Move Ships” substep of the “Movement” step, beginning with the active player and proceeding clockwise, each player may use the “Space Cannon” ability of each of their units in the active system by performing the following steps:

77.3. STEP 1 — ROLL DICE: The player rolls dice for each of their units in the active system that has the “Space Cannon” ability; this is a space cannon roll. One hit is produced for each result that is equal to or greater than the unit’s “Space Cannon” value.
* If a unit has a “Space Cannon” ability, it is present on its faction sheet and technology cards.
* “Space Cannon” is displayed as “Space Cannon X (Y).” The X is the minimum value needed for a die to produce a hit, and Y is the number of dice rolled. Not all “Space Cannon” abilities are accompanied by a (Y) value; a space cannon roll for such a unit consists of one die.
* If a player has a PDS unit upgrade technology, they can use the “Space Cannon” ability of their PDS units that are in systems that are adjacent to the active system. The hits are still assigned to units in the active system.
* Game effects that reroll, modify, or otherwise affect combat rolls do not affect space cannon rolls.

77.4. This ability can be used even if no ships were moved during the “Move Ships” step.

77.5. STEP 2 — ASSIGN HITS: The player whose units have been targeted by “Space Cannon” must choose and destroy one of their ships in the active system for each hit result produced against their units.
* Players other than the active player must target the active player’s units.
* If the active player is using the “Space Cannon” ability of their units, they choose a player who has ships in the active system. That player must choose and destroy one of their ships in the active system for each hit the space cannon roll produced.

77.6. SPACE CANNON DEFENSE
During the invasion step of a tactical action, after ground forces have been committed to land on planets, players other than the active player can resolve the “Space Cannon” abilities of their units on those planets by performing the following these steps:

77.7. STEP 1 — ROLL DICE: Each player may use the “Space Cannon” ability of each of their units on the invaded planet by rolling a specific number of dice for each of those units; this is called a space cannon roll. A hit is produced for each die roll that is equal to or greater than the unit’s “Space Cannon” value.
* If a unit has a “Space Cannon” ability, it is present on its faction sheet and technology cards.
* “Space Cannon” is displayed as “Space Cannon X (Y).” The X is the minimum value needed for a die to produce a hit, and Y is the number of dice rolled. Not all “Space Cannon” abilities are accompanied by a (Y) value; a space cannon roll for such a unit consists of one die.
* Game effects that reroll, modify, or otherwise affect combat rolls do not affect space cannon rolls.
* Game effects that allow the use of “Space Cannon” abilities against ships in adjacent systems have no effect during Space Cannon Defense.

77.8 STEP 2 — ASSIGN HITS: The active player must choose and destroy one of their ground forces on the planet for each hit the space cannon roll produced.
* Hits can only be assigned to units that were committed to the same planet as the units using the “Space Cannon” ability.

### 87. Sustain Damage
Some units have the “Sustain Damage” ability. Immediately before a player assigns hits to their units, that player can use the “Sustain Damage” ability of any of their units in the active system.

87.1. For each “Sustain Damage” ability that a player uses, one hit produced by another player’s units is canceled. Then, each unit using this ability is placed on its side to indicate that it is damaged.

87.2. A damaged unit does not have reduced capabilities and is functionally the same as an undamaged unit, except that it cannot use the “Sustain Damage” ability.

87.3. A damaged unit cannot use the “Sustain Damage” ability until it is repaired during the status phase or by another game effect.

87.4. A unit can use its “Sustain Damage” ability any time a hit is produced against it. This includes hits produced during combat and from unit abilities such as the “Space Cannon” ability.
* A unit can only use the “Sustain Damage” ability if it is eligible to be hit. For example, a player cannot use a dreadnought’s “Sustain Damage” ability to cancel a hit from “Anti-Fighter Barrage.”

87.5. The “Sustain Damage” ability cannot be used to cancel an effect that directly destroys a unit.

87.6. The Barony of Letnev’s “Non-Euclidean Shielding” faction technology allows the Letnev player’s units with the “Sustain Damage” ability to cancel up to two hits instead of one.
