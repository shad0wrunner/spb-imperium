## 16. Capacity
16.1. 
- A unit’s capacity value indicates the maximum combined number of fighters and ground forces that it can transport.

16.2.
- The combined capacity values of a player’s ships in a system determine the number of fighters and ground forces that player can have in that system’s space area.

16.3. 
- If a player has more fighters and ground forces in the space area of a system than the total capacity of that player’s ships in that system, that player must remove the excess units.
- A player can choose which of their excess units to remove.
- Ground forces on planets do not count against capacity.
- A player’s fighters and ground forces do not count against capacity during combat. At the end of combat, any excess units are removed and returned to that player’s reinforcements.

16.4. 
- Fighters and ground forces are not assigned to specific ships, except while they are being transported.

> 1) If a ship with capacity is destroyed during the "Space Cannon Offense" step, capacity limits must be met before space combat starts.
> 2) Capacity is checked after the winner of a space combat is determined. As such, it is possible to win a space combat with only fighters remaining, before removing those fighters due to lack of capacity.
