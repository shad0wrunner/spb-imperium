### 9. Anomalies
An anomaly is a system tile that has unique rules.

9.1. An anomaly is identified by a red border located on the tile’s corners.

9.2. There are four types of anomalies: asteroid fields, nebulae, supernovas, and gravity rifts.
- Some anomalies contain planets; those systems are still anomalies.

9.3. Each type of anomaly is identified by its art, as follows:
- Asteroid Field
- Nebula
- Supernova
- Gravity Rift

9.4. Abilities can cause a system tile to become an anomaly; that system tile is an anomaly in addition to its other properties.

9.5. Abilities can cause a system to be two different anomalies; that system has the properties of both anomalies.

### 11. Asteroid Field
An asteroid field is an anomaly that affects movement.

11.1. A ship cannot move through or into an asteroid field.

### 41. Gravity Rift
A gravity rift is an anomaly that affects movement.

41.1. A ship that will move out of or through a gravity rift at any time during its movement, applies +1 to its move value.
- This can allow a ship to reach the active system from farther away than it normally could.

41.2. For each ship that would move out of or through a gravity rift, one die is rolled immediately before it exits the gravity rift system; on a result of 1–3, that ship is removed from the board.
- Dice are not rolled for units that are being transported by ships with capacity.
- Units that are being transported are removed from the board if the ship transporting them is removed from the board.
- Units that are removed are returned to the player’s reinforcements.

41.3. A gravity rift can affect the same ship multiple times during a single movement.

41.4. A system that contains multiple gravity rifts is treated as a single gravity rift.

### 59. Nebula
A nebula is an anomaly that affects movement and combat.

59.1. A ship can only move into a nebula if it is the active system.
- A ship cannot move through a nebula. That is, a ship cannot move into and out of a nebula during the same movement.

59.2. A ship that begins the “Movement” step of a tactical action in a nebula treats its move value as “1” for the duration of that step.
- Other abilities and effects can increase this number.

59.3. If a space combat occurs in a nebula, the defender applies +1 to each combat roll of their ships during that combat.

### 86. Supernova
A supernova is an anomaly that affects movement.

86.1. A ship cannot move through or into a supernova.
