# Общие принципы

Аномалии это специальные тайлы, которые визуально выделены красной пунктирной границей по краям тайла. Наличии красной тыльной стороны не является признаком аномалии.  
В игре существует 4 типа аномалии: астероидное поле, сверхновая, гравитационный колодец и туманность. Основная характеристика, которая объединяет их: у каждой аномалии свои, отличные от стандартных тайлов, правила перемещения (move) в, из и через них.  
Ключевой момент, на который регулярно не обращают внимания неопытные игроки - правила перемещения отрядов в аномалии не влияют на правила активации этих тайлов, размещения отрядов в них или прочих действий в них. Хрестоматийный пример: хотя корабли не могут перемещать через или внутрь астероидного поля, но, если в нём есть какая-либо червоточина, они могут разместить в ней корабль посредством карты действия или активировать эту систему и выполнить залп ПСО в неё.

### 9. Anomalies
An anomaly is a system tile that has unique rules.

9.1. An anomaly is identified by a red border located on the tile’s corners.

9.2. There are four types of anomalies: asteroid fields, nebulae, supernovas, and gravity rifts.
- Some anomalies contain planets; those systems are still anomalies.

9.3. Each type of anomaly is identified by its art, as follows:
- Asteroid Field
- Nebula
- Supernova
- Gravity Rift

9.4. Abilities can cause a system tile to become an anomaly; that system tile is an anomaly in addition to its other properties.

9.5. Abilities can cause a system to be two different anomalies; that system has the properties of both anomalies.

### 11. Asteroid Field
An asteroid field is an anomaly that affects movement.

11.1. A ship cannot move through or into an asteroid field.

> 1) A player with the Antimass Deflectors technology may move their ships through asteroid fields.

***

### 41. Gravity Rift
A gravity rift is an anomaly that affects movement.

41.1. A ship that will move out of or through a gravity rift at any time during its movement, applies +1 to its move value.
- This can allow a ship to reach the active system from farther away than it normally could.

41.2. For each ship that would move out of or through a gravity rift, one die is rolled immediately before it exits the gravity rift system; on a result of 1–3, that ship is removed from the board.
- Dice are not rolled for units that are being transported by ships with capacity.
- Units that are being transported are removed from the board if the ship transporting them is removed from the board.
- Units that are removed are returned to the player’s reinforcements.

41.3. A gravity rift can affect the same ship multiple times during a single movement.

41.4. A system that contains multiple gravity rifts is treated as a single gravity rift.

> 1) A ship removed by a gravity rift is not destroyed.
> 2) All ship movement must be declared before any roll for gravity rift removal. A player may not move additional ships after seeing the result of this roll.
> 3) A ship that is removed by a gravity rift will not count toward the fleet limit in the destination system.
> 4) If a ship moves through or out of multiple gravity rifts, and/or the same gravity rift multiple times, each instance will provide a +1 to movement, and requires a separate roll for removal.
> 5) A system containing a Vuil’raith Dimensional Tear is a gravity rift, and thus an anomaly.
> 6) Moving into a gravity rift will not provide the +1, nor will the ships have to roll for removal.

### 59. Nebula
A nebula is an anomaly that affects movement and combat.

59.1. A ship can only move into a nebula if it is the active system.
- A ship cannot move through a nebula. That is, a ship cannot move into and out of a nebula during the same movement.

59.2. A ship that begins the “Movement” step of a tactical action in a nebula treats its move value as “1” for the duration of that step.
- Other abilities and effects can increase this number.

59.3. If a space combat occurs in a nebula, the defender applies +1 to each combat roll of their ships during that combat.

> 1) The +1 modifier for the defender has no effect during ground combat.
> 2) The +1 modifier for the defender does not modify anti–fighter barrage, bombardment or space cannon rolls.

***

### 86. Supernova
A supernova is an anomaly that affects movement.

86.1. A ship cannot move through or into a supernova.

> If a ship finds itself in a supernova by some uncommon game effect, it may remain there and move out without harm.
