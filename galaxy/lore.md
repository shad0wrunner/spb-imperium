# Twilight Imperium Lore

### TWILIGHT IMPERIUM: BORDERLANDS

The Past and Present. . . 

Mecatol Rex! A splendid pearl in the ebony blackness of space, an illuminated living splendor of wealth, intellect, and trade. Ruled by the mighty Lazax, masters of the stars and the planets for a trillion parsec, the Imperial race. The great factions: N'orr, XXcha, Hacan, Letnev, Jol-Nar, and Sol, all humbly acknowledged the Lazax rule, and together the races formed a great council to advise and debate issues ultimately decided by the 
Lazax Emperor. For countless ages it was thus, glory, progress, and collaboration under the emperor. 

Ever so slowly things began to change. The galaxy reached an equilibrium and slowly turned stagnant. Political energy soon turned to clashing patriotic factions, and interracial power struggles began to flare. As technological and intellectual growth stalled, the political tension reached critical mass, and it was during this age that the first accounts of actual physical conflict between the great races were recorded in annals of his-
tory. This era of growing darkness became known as the Age of Dusk. 

In the beginning, the Lazax still held ultimate authority, without question! The Lazax, however, blinded by the assurance of eternal rule, were only slightly concerned about the intensifying power struggle between the great races. They failed to see the disastrous results of this cancer. As the tensions between the great races grew deeper, so grew their ambitions. The Lazax failed to see the danger of ambition, because what seat could be more desirable than that of the Emperor himself? Secret, unspoken desire began to drive the leaders of the great races. Hunger and lust to become the ruling race, the zenith, the empire itself! By the end of the Age of Dusk, weapons and espionage had become the crux of technological progression. 

Then, one day, a small political affair near the Quann passage, erupted into armed conflict that spread like a wildfire through the galaxy. The Quann Conflict marks the beginning of the Age of Twilight. 

Of all the planets in the galaxy, no planet was more war-torn than central Mecatol Rex. Only the inner Imperial City yet remains from the destruction of the Twilight Wars. Protected by its Winneran custodians, the inner city shields were maintained and a functioning council was held throughout the wars. The Lazax, however, were not so fortunate. As the ruling race, the imperial fleets struggled to keep the war under control and so became the natural enemy of all the great races. Over the course of merely twenty years, the Lazax presence in the galaxy was completely removed. No Lazax has been seen in the galaxy for more than 6000 years. The Imperial throne in the great council now stands empty. The Winnaran custodians keep the shattered Mecatol Rex functioning and the council running. 

The Twilight Wars lasted for centuries, but no race was powerful enough to seize the throne, willing to risk the fate of the Lazax. Countless resources and vast development went into weapons of destruction. Slowly the economies of the great races began to crumble under the intolerable strain of never-ending conflict. Civilization and technology slowly regressed. 

The Twilight Wars never ended on one specific date, but rather subsided as the great races tumbled into a dark age of economic and intellectual disaster. The great factions retreated into small, safe areas of space. 

It has been thousands of years since the last known armed conflict between the races. But with their economies rebuilt, ambition has begun to flare once more. On Mecatol Rex, the council has begun to gain importance and influence. The great races have again begun the slow annexation of nearby systems. Step by step bringing back former glory and greatness. 

The Imperial Throne remains empty, the Winnarans still custodians of its greatness. But it seems certain that the Age of Twilight is coming to an end, and that one great race will soon gain enough influence to capture the Empire and bring about a new age of galactic greatness.

### TWILIGHT IMPERIUM: DISTANT SUNS

After extensive space-travel, you begin to fail hearing the humming of the mass-engines. Their deep resonance simply becomes a part of your daily environment. Fleet officers often subconsciously associate the sound with safety and comfort. It was therefore strange to Unlenn that it was this sound that interrupted his deep thoughts as he stood in the air-lift onboard the *Miskac*. Admiral, Lord of Wenn, Master of Blades, and he was ... nervous? Admiral Unlenn shook his head in tense amusement. This was the first time that he had the pleasure of transporting the Baron himself. But, as the newly appointed First Admiral, it was probably a thing to grow accustomed to. Probably.

The two Guards that escorted Unlenn felt his uneasiness. They exchanged a brief look, and decided that today they would pay extra attention to detail. Military protocol was an important, lethal, doctrine in the Letnev fleet.

The air-lift stopped. The somber display indicated that they had arrived at the executive quarters of the *Miskac*, quarters especially designed for the ruling family. The door opened with a whisper, and the Admiral strode briskly forward into the darkened room. The room's viewshields were open and starlight illuminated the walls. The still figure of the Baron stood as a black outline against the stars looking aft. Baron Daz Emmiciel Werqan IV. Proud, noble, just, and cruel. One of the most powerful men in the universe.

Unlenn fell to his knees, his grey robe spreading about him.

'Command me, my Baron.'

The dark figure slowly turned. Bleak shadows beneath heavy, sleek eyebrows studied the newcomers. With a surprising soft voice, he spoke.

'Guard, you are dismissed.'

Without showing too much relief, the guard snapped about. They retreated back into the waiting air-lift, whose doors closed swiftly, leaving the two senior Letnevians alone. The baron glanced at the kneeling officer, slightly amused.

'Rise, Unlenn. Come speak with me!'

The Baron turned against towards the viewshield. The departing Mecatol Rex System was now a diminishing golden flare of light toward the bow end of the mighty Dreadnought. Unlenn spoke cordially.

'I trust that the council of races went well, my Baron.'

The Admiral wondered what had transpired behind the closed doors of the council in the past three days. There had been an odd tension in the old Imperial city. Unlenn had felt that something was awry within the higher echelons of power.

'Well, yes, well...' the Baron cleared his voice, 'I feel, dear Unlenn, that we are reaching a watershed for our galaxy. Sentiments are changing, and time has come for us to ... shall I say... restore... what once was!'

'How do you mean, My Baron?'

'As you know, my dear Admiral, historically the council has looked critically upon territorial expansion, but the temperament seemingly has changed. As as matter of fact, I do believe that the Humans will annex the Emelpar system this cycle. They made their intensions very clear. Yes, very clear...'

'But the council...'

'It seemed that most of other races have certain... interests... of their own, and Sol annexation of Emelpar will function to create a new precedent.'

'But that would inevitably mean war, my Baron!'

The Baron turned slowly towards his Admiral, a hidden smile spreading to his eyes. *So this Admiral had political foresight!* A useful man, the Baron thought. And a dangerous man! It would be prudent to keep this Admiral close to home. It had not been an uncommon thing, in the Letnev past, for a well placed admiral or official to attempt a coup against the Family. Every attempt had failed; of course, it always paid to be careful.

'Yes, Unlenn, war will come.'

The Admiral shifted his feet. 'But my Lord, we still have a vital problem with basic logistics, it...'

The Baron lifted his hand, silencing the Admiral with his gesture.

'During the last three days, I have made an... arrangement with the Jol-Nar.'

'The fishmen? But my Baron...'

Another gesture silenced the Admiral. The Baron took a deep breath, and spoke while glaring at myriad of stars before him.

'Admiral, is our fleet still massing around Quann?'

'Yes, my Baron.'

'And the cursed Hacan?'

'Their fleet is docked at Arrezte, but my Baron...'

'Admiral. Look upon these luminous stars. These distant suns! They harbor fruitful harvests, and wealth upon which to build an empire.'

The Baron of Letnev turned fully towards his Admiral. And, in the military tradition of Letnev, removed a glove from his belt and handed it to his First Admiral: the symbolic permission to strike with the Baron's full might. The Baron formally addressed his most senior officer with a sharp voice.

'Admiral, will you follow my command?'

'Yes, my Baron!' Unlenn fell to his knees.

'All these distant suns... You shall make them mine!'

### TWILIGHT IMPERIUM: OUTER RIM

"...Third shift, 1300 hours, all is clear." 

The display in front of Captain Willard confirmed the deck officer's announcement. All sectors showed normal activity, and the approach spectrum on his intelligence-pad indicated no potential threats within striking distance. 

The PDS command information center on the planet Emelpar was a large, dimly-lit room bursting with monitoring technology and blue-clad personnel. The wealthy and historically significant planet of Emelpar had been the Federation of Sols first successful annexation in more than a thousand years, and billions of credits had gone into the protection of the system. Since the Emelpar annexation, several other systems had fallen under the umbrella of the Federation. Sol was now a leading contender for political control of the galaxy. 

Willard nodded to himself and punched the 'All Clear' confirmation button on his report-pad. He quietly studied the large monitors before him. In Sector 0, the cluster of green triangles confirmed that a small Sol task force led by the Dreadnought *Paris* was still in the system undergoing repairs and system checks. The Emelpar facilities were top-notch and a popular stop for fleet down-time. Willard nodded again and took a sip of his coffee. Sitting down in his chair, he let out a contented sigh, and began to read the activity report from the previous two shifts. 

Interesting. The elite cruiser *Mitterand* had brought an important person to Emelpar this afternoon. None other than Supreme Admiral DeLouis! Something must be brewing! Perhaps he was here to decide the future assignment of the *Paris* Task Force. 

Willard looked up at the readiness marker. It was at a normal '7.' He would have guessed that readiness would have been increased with such important brass here. Then again, there seemed to be no threat at this time. Willard lost himself in the reports. 

"...Proximity Alert, Third Sectorю Hyperspace bubble forming." The deck officer's announcement jolted Willard out of his concentration. 

In front of him, on the third sector monitors, a red flash was indicating an unscheduled arrival. Probably nothing! Most likely a harried merchant that had forgotten to log in his arrival data. Happened a few times a day. Nothing to worry about. 

As the hyperbubble dissolved, multiple large red dots materialized in its place. Coffee exploded from Willard's lips onto the monitor in front of him as he jumped, startled. 

The deck officer's voice boomed across the room again. "...Twenty-two unidentified ships arriving in sector three. Alert! Alert! We may have inbound enemy ships. Alert! Alert!" Red lights began flashing everywhere. The control center burst into life. Willard rose from the chair and surveyed the situation. This was not good. Not good! 

Willard flipped on a small microphone on his control-board. "CO! Give me readouts on those ships! I need identification, threat analysis and possible approach vectors. Now!" 

Willard turned the microphone off and studied the newly-arrived ships. 

Strange task force formation! Unlike any that Willard had previously studied. Definitely not a Letnev fleet, it lacked the typical Letnev triad-formations. It also did not identify with any of Sol s current allies. Willard glanced at the threat-board again. Damn intelligence! According to this report there were no enemy or allied fleets of any significant size within immediate reach of Emelpar. 

Then what was that fleet doing up there? Willard glanced again at the readiness indicator. A '4.' This was not happening fast enough. He needed information now! 

"What about that ID? " Willard's voice boomed once again over the intercom. He saw the CO leave his post from the floor and run up the stairs towards him. Willard waited calmly as the winded CO reached him.

"Yes? " Willard turned. The CO cleared his throat.

"Captain, the ship specifications indicate that this fleet belong to one one the Rim civilizations. The.... El... Elwonzewonex, sir. According to my intelligence reports, they should not have half the fleet that just jumped out of hyper-space!" 

Willard knew a potential disaster was unfolding before him. "How about the threat analysis?" 

The CO showed the Captain his second printout. "Central command has labeled the Elwonzewonex a volatile race, sir. And a likely enemy. Yet, the same report also labels them a low level threat -- a minor galactic power." 

Willard took the report. The data on the sheet indicated that the L1z1x should possess virtually no fleet. Willard shook his head, and glanced at the huge task force on the central screen. Somebody had messed up royally.

"Communication?" he asked. 

The CO shook his head. "None, sir. They're not answering our hails, and have paid no attention to our warnings. " 

Willard leaned forward and flipped a red corn-switch on his executive relay board. Central Planetary Defense, located on the south pole of Emelpar, responded immediately. 

"Central Defense here, Corporal Gonzales speaking!" The signal was clear. Willard took a 
deep breath. 

"Gonzales! This is commanding officer Willard at CIC. Identification Delta Delta Georgia London 895. We are under attack, repeat, we are under attack. Approaching enemy task force in the third sector. This is not a drill, repeat, this is NOT a drill." 

"Yes sir, requesting confirmation." 

Following protocol, the CO leaned over the microphone. "Confirmed. The this is CIC CO Albertson. Repeat. We are under attack. Initiate all defensive systems and engage countermeasures. My identification number Delta Delta Tokyo Oslo 873." 

"Acknowledged, sir. Stand by. Engaging shield, initiating countermeasures!" Gonzales logged off. A minute later the general alarm sounded. The lights in the CIC dimmed slightly as enormous reserves of energy were transferred to the planetary shield, and world-wide energy sinks were powered up. Willard glanced at the readiness indicator. A '2!'. Emelpar was almost ready for battle. 

"Sir, we are spotting more than a hundred landing craft emerging from four enemy carriers, sir. The *Paris* task force is moving to intercept, but is heavily outgunned..." The voice of the deck officer was clearly heard over the alarms and buzzing activity of the CIC.

Willard could not help flinching. Good God! more than a *hundred* landing craft. That would be more than six divisions! The Emelpar ground defenses were a standard two divisions. 

The ground shook slightly as huge planet-wide magcannons began pounding energy bolts at the approaching enemy. Blast streaks and heat-barrages made the overhead screens hard to decipher. 

Time passed, maybe an hour. 

The deck officer's voice rang out again, "The *Paris* has been destroyed, The *Mitterand* has been destroyed! Enemy landings have commenced across five major planetary centers." Willard watched his staff turn increasingly frantic in their efforts. There was an obvious concern for their own safety. 

Willard drew his sidearm and checked the ammunition. He then switched on the CIC intercom controller in front of him. His voice boomed over the hectic room. "Attention all personnel. Destroy all sensitive data and man your gun-ready positions. Anticipate an enemy ground attack. " 

Willard watched for a second as the people followed his orders. Weapon lockers were being opened, marines began leading squadrons to their defensive perimeters. Vast quantities of data were being deleted, data drives ejected from their slots and deposited in magnetic shredders. Willard leaned over the microphone once more. "And... ladies and gentlemen..." 

"Good Luck." 

The battle of Emelpar had begun.

TWILIGHT IMPERIUM THIRD EDITION

My name is Mahthom Iq Seerva. 

I am the Winnaran keeper of the Custodian Chronicle, and I write this from the ancient Tower of Annals in old Mecatol City. Since inheriting the duties of the chronicle from my father, I have enjoyed the view of our city from my wide windows; enjoyed the old buildings, ancient towers, and bright lights that proudly stretch into the remote distance. Yet, like the shadow at my feet, I can never escape or forget the lethal finite borders of my city. I cannot cast aside the fact that less than a hundred leagues from this tower, our city shields rise to protect us from the poisonous dust that is the Sea of Desolation. The terrible wasteland that covers our planet.

My people, the Winnarans, have kept this city safe for more than three thousandyears. Ever since the time of the great scourge, we have been the custodians of the imperial throne, the imperial records, and the galactic council here on Mecatol Rex. We have indeed been faithful to the promise that we made to the last emperor.

My hands tremble as I write this. Events are now unfolding which I believe to be the harbinger of great change. I foresee that, in my lifetime, our custodianship will come to an end. This is why I have contacted you. I will here seek to give you a brief, but true, summary of the recent history of our galaxy. I give this to you, because I know that you will spread this knowledge far and wide. As we enter the dangerous years before us, I fear that the galaxy shall have a great need of the past.

It is told that the Lazax emperors arose from the ashes of the Mahact kings. Little is known of their early ascension, but it is impossible to deny that the Lazax must have been a profoundly intelligent, benevolent, and wise people. After their prehistoric rise to power, we know that they chose the central planet of Mecatol Rex as their home world. The year that the Lazax first arrived on Mecatol Rex is recorded in the Imperial Chronicle as "first" and marks the beginning of my account. 

For untold ages, the Lazax ruled the known galaxy. As new races came into contact with the empire, they would be allowed to join the Galactic Council that represented the needs and voices of the empires people. The great races: Xxcha, Hacan, Letnev, Hylar, Sol, and N'orr were all represented in the council during the last time of the Lazax empire. 

Yet, as the years passed, discoveries of new races and planetary systems began to slow. Little by little the mood of the empire changed as technological and intellectual growth began to diminish. In their need for advancement, the great races began instead to look to the power of the Lazax and the resources of their neighbors. Greed and ambition slowly grew in the hearts of statesmen and councilors. The spirit of the empire turned suspicious and fearful. It is during this time that the first conflicts between the great races are recorded in the Imperial Chronicle. The Galactic Council became a seedbed of intrigue, ushering in an era of spies and assassins. First in secret, and later in public, the great races began at this time to build their military capabilities. Many started territorial expansions that extended beyond their original charter. Border strife and resource disputes began to proliferate, gnawing at the very foundations of the empire. This was a time of growing darkness that is now known as the Age of Dusk.

Throughout most of this age, the Lazax held authority without question. Except for a few minor and unsuccessful rebellions, few dared to openly challenge the emperors. Yet, blinded by assurance of eternal rule, the Lazax did not perceive the threat of ambition that grew around them. As years passed, tensions between the great races grew deeper, and so did their hunger for power. In the end, they held only one thing in common: They hated the Lazax, hated the imperial rule, and hated the benevolent arrogance of the emperors.

A small affair near the Quann wormhole was the spark that set the galaxy aflame.

In protest over imperial trade oversight, the Baron of Letnev had begun a blockade of trade traffic through the Quann wormhole. As this had been far from the first trouble with the Letnev, an unconcerned Lazax emperor sought to solve the conflict peacefully in the Galactic Council. 

Then, without warning, the blockading Letnev ships were attacked and annihilated by a Sol task force acting without imperial mandate. Losing valuable trade-income, the Sol federation had lost patience, and had acted in its own interest. 

Angered, the emperor attempted to consolidate his control by issuing the Maandu edict, which would place all warships under direct imperial supervision. The Maandu edict would be the stone that shattered a brittle empire. After this proclamation, the Letnev, Sol, and Jol-Nar civilizations announced their immediate withdrawal from the council, drawing the galaxy into civil war. 

The Quann conflict marks the beginning of the Age of Twilight.

As race fought race, as a thousand territorial disputes erupted over a few years, the Lazax desperately sought to assert their authority. Holding together a crumbling empire, Lazax fleets fought across the galaxy. The final days of the Lazax began in the seventy-third year of the war. Without warning, an alliance of Sol, N'orr, and Hacan attacked Mecatol Rex itself. 

Of all the planets in the galaxy, no planet was more war-torn than Mecatol Rex. Over the course of only a few years, the planet’s ecology was ravaged by bombardments, its population decimated, and its green fields blasted into a toxic wasteland. The last Lazax emperor and his entire family were executed during an early Sol incursion and no successor was named.

After the death of the last emperor, all semblance of Lazax control collapsed. The Lazax people became hunted across the galaxy in the vengeful wave of murder that is known as the great scourge. Lasting only twenty years, the scourge resulted in the complete annihilation of the Lazax race. Until now, no Lazax had been seen in the
known galaxy for more than 3000 years.

The Twilight Wars continued for centuries. Yet no race was powerful enough to seize the throne and risk the fate of the Lazax. Slowly the strength of the great civilizations failed as their economies crumbled and whole technologies were lost from the strain of long war. 

The Twilight Wars died in a slow whisper. The time that followed, now known as the Dark Years, was a period of economic, cultural, and intellectual collapse. The great races had by then retreated into their own small, safe areas of space.

With time, the Dark Years did come to an end, and a calm but uncertain period of rebuilding began. As I write this, the great races have regained elements of their former strength. In my city, the Galactic Council is growing in influence once more, while the great races are embarking on the colonization of neighboring systems, abandoned during the Dark Years. 

The signs of great change are everywhere. I taste it in the air I breathe. This year, as if walking out of ancient prophecy, the Lazax returned from the darkness of history in a foreboding cybernetic form. To me, their coming is like the first wind of a terrible storm. I feel as if the galaxy is waking. As if an ancient beast stirs from slumber in a dark cave.

The day will soon come when a new empire will rise. For the sake of all, may the new emperor not only have the power to seize the throne, but the strength to conquer the peace.

If not, I fear that a sea of desolation will drown us all.
