Примечание: на данный момент страница представляет собой копию https://www.reddit.com/r/twilightimperium/comments/i8y2qa/a_twilight_imperium_timline/

Having wanted a quick timeline of events for some time, i was unable to find one and decided to create one myself.

As a quick note, i wanted see the chronological order of the races who joined the Lazax, but was unable to find any source. The closest i got was the intro by Mahthom Iq Seerva (TI3 rulebook intro), but it quickly became weird, as he dosen’t list the Saar nor the Winnu as a great civilization. The Xxcha is considered the oldest empire, but not necessary the first to encounter the Lazax. He also lists the Sardok n’orr after the humans, which we know to be the youngest race and the latest to join the imperium.

Their might be many minor empires, in which we have never heard about, which encountered and joined the Lazax.

1 # - Small gramma mistakes are fixed, Added Sardok N'orr invasion of Lisis.
2 # - Edited the Nomad, as it dosen't seem to travel back in time to warn about the Mahact. added section about the failed Lazax invasion of Retillion.



BTW – Before the Twilight Wars

21.000 BTW – Fall of the Mad Kings - For an unknown amount of time, The Mahact Gene-sorcerers has ruled supreme as kings over the known galaxy. As their hold on their star empire began to crumble, the Lazax Empire rises to challenge them. The last Mahact King falls at the hand of the First Lazax emperor, an a new era begins.

With their philosophy of Peace and strength, instead of completely eradicating the Mahact race, the Lazax chooses to exile and imprison them om their homeworld of Ixth, and charges the avian species of the Argent Flight, former slaves of the Mahact, to act as their wardens.

Before their complete defeat, the Mahact hides clues and prophecies about the people of Ixth, and their paradise world, in the hope that someone, someday, will be foolish enough to find and release them from their prison.

20.000 BTW – The Lazax swept through the former crumbling Mahact territory, and gave each of the former enslaved civilizations an offer: accept their benevolent rule, or the madness of denying them. The tyranny of the Mahact caused few to refuse their offer, and those who did, no records remains.

· The Golden age – 20.000 BTW - The Age of Dusk.

· The people of Saar is encountered and discriminated against(I guess?).

· The Lazax encounters the Winnaran and saves them from extinction, and the Winnaran in turn swears fealty to the Lazax.

· The Lazax encounters and vassalize the Letnev. During the golden age, the Letnev rebels twice, both ending in their defeat.

· The Lazax encounters the Hylar, and the Twilight Empire slowly but surely starts to become depended on them and their advanced technology.

· The Hacan are transformed from a poor people to the galatic tradecenter of the empire.

· The Sardook N'orr conquores the Saar colony of Lisis, the local saar population where never seen again. This led to the tradtion of Saar females carrying a silver pendant to remember their lost world.

· The Yssaril homeworld of Retillion is invaded by the Lazax. The Lazax suffers a humiliating defeat in a guerrilla war. After years of conflict, the Lazax leaves Retillion, in return, the Yssaril would supply the Lazax with their planets rare resources and provide the service of their renowned and feared Guild of Spies.

As the golden aged neared its end, and conflict and ambition started to split the vassal races of the Twilight Imperium, they all began to covet the Golden Throne of Mechatol Rex.

??? BTW – Shortly before the Twilight Wars - The Hylar of Jol-Nar discoveres the planet of Muaat, and its fiery Gashlai inhabitants. The Hylar quickly steal Muaat of its resources, enslaves the Gashlai and used them to construction a gigantic shipyard, from which they would build their secret superweapons in the coming war.

x BTW – The Xxcha forsee the war and try to warn the emperor and his advisors. The only one to listen is Ibna Vel Syd, who in vain tries to warn his people of the coming disaster

1 BTW – The Letnev enacts a bloackade in the Quann system, preventing all trade through its wormhole. The Lazax, thinking that this was yet another minor Letnev rebellion which would end in failure, started negotiations with the Barony.

1 - The Twilight Wars – The Federation of Sol grows tired of the Lazax negotiations, and fires upon the Letnev blockade, starting the Twilight Wars. As the Letnevs and the Human fleets engage, The Lazax Armada tries to stop both forces, only to drag the empire in as a third participant.

1 TW – Seeing the opportunities the rebellion creates, The Headmaster of Jol-Nar abdictates the Empire.

X TW – Letnev Invasion - Baron Daz Arrokan I, invades the Xxcha Kingdom. They annex the planet of Archon Tau, while the Xxcha retains control over Archon Ren, as a tributary to the Barony.

+10 TW – The Federation of Sol defeats the Letnev fleet, and bombards the Letnev Controlled world of Archon Tau for the next two years, turning the green lush world into a black crater.

70 TW – Betrayal of Vel Syd - Ibna Vel Syd flees Mechatol Rex with a few thousand Lazax loyal to him onboard stolen ships. He burns Mechatol Rex's Halls of Cartography, to prevent anyone from figuring out where they flee.

71 TW – A Gashlai appears before the Imperial Court, and begs the Twilight Emperor free his people from the Hylar. As it shows the Emperor the Hylars Warsun schematics, the first bombardments of Mechatol Rex begins, and the emperor asks the Gashlai to flee and have his people make their own destiny.

71 TW – Bombing of Rex - As the local Hylar freeunions on Mechatol Rex strikes, thus crippling the planets defenses, a Federation of Sol fleet emerges, and starts to unopposed bombard the planet, taking no consideration as to whether they hit civilian or military targets. Its later confirmed, that the attack where a joint plan made between the Jol-Nar, Sol and the Hacan.

91 TW – Persecuted across the Galaxy, the Lazax goes extinct.

X TW – The Doolak Plague - Hylar miners on Muaat unearthed a violent plague, which travled quickly to their homeworlds and devasted their race, as the worst pandemic they have ever recorded.

X TW – Sardok N’orr Invasion – Following the Doolak Plague, the Sardok N’orr begins an invasion of Jol and Nar. To prevent their empires collapse, the Headmasters call upon their secret superweapons from Muaat, the “Warsuns”.

X TW - With most of the Jol-Nar forces out of the Gashlai’s homesystem, they incinerates what was left and took control over the enormous shipyards. The Jol-nar never recovered their military strength after the Sardok N’orr invasion, and where unable to retake Muaat.

X TW – Around halfway through the Twilight Wars - The Naalu, a previous unknown people, emerged from their hidden world of Maaluk. Their Telepatic powers quickly made them respected and fear amongst the other great races.

X TW – Ragh Gavar of the Saar, hears the call of the One Between the stars, and discoveres the unclaimed worlds of Lisis II and Ragh in the Jorun asteroid field. As Ragh Gavar disapperared, the Saar hears the call to Jorun, and their race gathers to celebrate the discovery of their new homeworlds.

X TW – The Yin Brotherhood - The Human Darien Van Hauge, after years of using forbidden clonning techniques, creates the race of Yin from his own and deceased wives’ genes.

X TW – The Mentak Coalition - Erwan Mentak, unites the prisoners of the abandoned Lazax prison world of Moll Primus, and forms the Mentak Coalition.

Centuries after the TW – The Naaz-Rokha Alliance - The Naaz, having suffered under different racial dictatorships since the start of the Twilight Wars, hires the Rokha to free them from their oppressors. In the aftermath, they invite them to stay as equals, and forms the Naaz-Rokha Alliance.

705 Years before the current age - The Nekro Virus - The L1Z1X scientist Mordai, goes insane and creates the nekro virus.

700 Years before the current age - The L1Z1X defeats the Nekro virus, which is belived to be permenantly destroyed. In reality, a small infected satellite are thrown out of Null's orbit. In time, the virus will be rebuild.



3000 TW – Current Age

X – The Creuss reveals themselves to the galaxy.

X – Following the assault on the Sol controlled world of Emelpar, the L1Z1X, formerly believe to be a minor backwater race with little to no military power, announces themselves to be surving Lazax, who have come to reclaim their empire.

X – Following a strings of conflict with the other races, the Federation of Sol and The Xxcha Kingdoms discover former L1Z1X colonies having been recently slaughtered by an entity, known as the Nekro Virus.



Speculations:

- The Nekro virus attacks the argent flights flagship and learn the location of their homeworld. As the Argent flight gather their forces to prevent an invasion, they momentarily turns their eyes away from Ixth, which allows a ship/fleet of Creuss origin, to approach the Mahact prison world. The Mahact quickly subjugates their Creuss saviors, turning them into the Crimson Legionnaires, and prepares to retake the galaxy.

- The Nomad and its five generals appears, allegedly from the future, and quickly deposes the stationmaster of Arcturus. With seemingly unkown and unending resources, they attempt to prevent som kind of future threat to the galaxy.

- The Empyreans, learning of the Mahact kings return, leaves their nebula homeworld and reveal themselves to the galaxy.

- The Mahact awakens the Titans of Ul, but for now, are unable to control them?
