## Hacan (TI1)

  Located in the Center of the Quenwari starcluster lies the tri-system of the Hacan. Circling the massive star Kenara are the three desert planets of the Hacan Emirate: Arretze, Kamm, and Hercant. Scorched by the merciless sun, the People of Hacan are nomads, moving their cities on massive on massive dust-sleds to cooler climates in the twilight dawn.
  
  In their distant past, the Hacan were a poor species, their exploits into space dwarfed by the other great factions of the forgone Lazax Imperium. Then the Hacan discovered the off-Worlders insatiable lust for special products grown under Kenaras blinding light: the intoxicating Gerr-Root, clothes made from the star-flowers that only bloom on Hercants equinox, multiple aphrodisiacs, liquors, and forbidden drugs harvested under Kenaras grace. In a short period of time the Hacan became masters of trade, and the tri-system prospered trade-clans. The desire to protect their wealth was the catalyst behind the formation of the cental Hacan Emirate goverment. The *Quieron*, leader of the Hacan, is chosen by a hierarchy of trade-groups, each possessing their own fleets of trade and war. The Quieron is the high-commander of the united merchant and warfleet, his motive: To lead the Hacan to the imperial throne, solidifying an era of wealth and commerce.

## Hacan (TI4)

  Under the punishing rays of the massive star Kenara lies the tri-system of the Hacan, each of its three satellites wrapped in the yellow haze so distinctive of desert planets. These three jewels are called Arretze, Kamdorn, and Hercant. Here, the united Emirates of the Hacan have grown a mighty civilization of warriors, nomads, farmers, and above all, merchants.
  
  The Kenara system is one of the most heavily trafficked in the known universe. Only the wormhole portal systems see more traffic in any given cycle. From Kenara, an untold number of Hacan and other merchant vessels traverse the galaxy. This traffic is supported by entire cities of space stations that provide the warehousing, logistics, maintenance, banking, entertainment, and other necessities facilitating the constant flow of goods, ships, and crew. 
  
  On the surface of the three hot desert planets, life is slower and more serene. Only life in the city of Harcarun on the planet Arretze matches the breathless pace of the space above. Located in a shadowy vale near the Arretze northern pole, Harcarun is the only city in the tri-system that has a fixed position. Its permanent location and almost bearable climate has made Harcarun the primary point of operation for most non-native trading corporations, financiers, and opportunists. The Hacan, despite their uncanny ability for establishing financial relationships and building trade, generally despise the chaotic lifestyle and, to them, windy cold of Harcarun.

  The Hacan people dwell mostly in cities built on massive dust-sleds, constantly moving to cooler climates as the desert seasons shift. Although some technology has been introduced in the last hundred years, most Hacan cities are still pulled by vast herds of Tuuran beasts, whose gill-like skin membranes take moisture from the very air itself.

  In their distant past, the Hacan were a poor species, their exploits into space dwarfed by the other great races of the Imperium. Then slowly the Hacan discovered an insatiable offworlder lust for special products grown under Kenara’s blinding light or dug from the deep sands of their homeworlds. The intoxicating gerr root, clothes made from the starflowers that only rise during Hercant’s equinox, Spehat aphrodisiacs, liquors, medicines, and forbidden drugs: all harvested and manufactured by the crafty and patient hands of the Hacan.

  Soon the Hacan became masters of trade, and their system prospered as unfathomable fortunes were made by the increasingly powerful trading clans, chief among them the Mowshir Emirate of Arretze. The desire to protect their newfound wealth, and a will to peacefully regulate and arbitrate between the clans, moved the Hacan to form a representative gathering and to elect a Quieron - the leader who speaks for all the Hacan. The Quieron leads the entire hierarchy of trade-groups, each possessing its own fleets of commerce and war. His task: to lead his people to the Imperial Throne, establishing an era of wealth and peaceful commerce."

## Jol-Nar (TI1)

  Only the oldest of the regents know the complete origin and evolution of the aquatic Hylar. Living in massive submerged floating cities, the water-breathing Jol-Nar is a species whose intense passion for technology is unrivaled anywhere in the Galaxy. Human scholars have speculated that this genetic passion for technology is an evolutionary sign of environmental strain, and that the physically weak Jol-Nar evolved intelligence and ambition to offset the external threat of aggressive off-worlders.
  
  The governing system of the Jol-Nar is that of a vast house of education. The *Head Master* and his *Circle of Regents* are based in the small city of Nhillar in the warm waters of the red ocean on Jol. Part mammal, part fish, the Jol-Nar are capable of breating surface air for extremely long periods of time (some have been measured to severeal years). The race is most comfortable submerged, however, and their compact build renders them immune to liquid depth pressure. The Jol-Nar are often considered by other races to be impatient and rude. This is surely a reflection of the Jol-Nar culture which is extremely competitive and ambitious. The Circle of Regents believes that the Jol-Nar is a completely superior race and will not tolerate any obstruction in their search of intellectual and technological improvement.

## Letnev

  In the very blackness of space lies Arc Prime. Here the Baron preside over a vast underground populace. Dwelling in enormous subterranean caverns, great cities are generously heated by the core of the planet. The Letnev exploit their easy access to the immense metallurgic riches of Arc Prime, and their ship-yards are the most impressive in the galaxy. The Baron nurtures and prods an aggressive militant people which he channels into subordination by impressive discipline and the maintenance of a strict military bureaucracy. The pale Letnev people despise excessive light, and will often wear protective eyewear when travelling on planets with normal sunlight.
  
  The everlasting dilemma of the Letnev is their need for food and biological nutrition. Though an army of droids manage vast underground fungus caverns, the population of the Barony have far outgrown what Arc Prime and its barren sister planet, Wren Terra, can muster in foodstuffs and liquid. The ancient Lazax Imperium kept the Barony under control by always closely monitoring the food supply to the Letnev.
  
  The Letnev military receives a training so intense and effective it is only surpassed by the *Tekklar Elite* troops on distant Quinarra. The Baron has always had only one flaring ambition: To become Emperor at any cost...

## Arborec (TI4)

  On first approach to Nestphar, a first-time visitor may be surprised by the soupy haze that bleeds from the planet’s atmosphere like a dusty cloud. This cloud consists of quadrillions of tiny living spores emitted by Nestphar’s many Flaah, city-sized floating forests in its stratosphere. The short-lived (and therefore continually resupplied) orbital presence of the Flaah spores allows the Arborec denizens in Nestphar's space-stations and shipyards to remain in continuous symbiotic contact with their planet. The Arborec term for this vital connection, shared among all living things on Nestphar, is best translated as "the Symphony."
  
  When traveling beyond the reach of Nestphar‘s Flaah spores, and therefore outside connection to the prime Symphony, the Arborec employ the massive Letani. Physically, the Letani are the largest sentient beings yet discovered in the galaxy (each slightly larger than a Sol elephantus), their bodies resembling a kraken-shaped mushroom crossed with a monstrous carnivorous flower. The Letani are each uniquely capable of embodying a powerful instance of the Symphony (and are therefore closest to an “individual” within Arborec society) which may act as a harmonic nexus for Arborec organisms in near proximity. All ships in the Arborec fleet are based around the presence of at least one (with some ships as many as five) Letani orchestrating the unity of Arborec lifeforms crewing the vessel. Once a Letani returns to the embrace of Nestphar’s prime Symphony, its experiences are reconnected and absorbed into the Arborec, as a data-capsule would be reconnected to its mainframe.
    
  While surely intelligent and demonstrably capable of crafting impressive technologies, structures, and a sophisticated fleet of interstellar craft, the Arborec‘s method of communication remains a source of great controversy. Being a race of vegetative and fungal matter, handling its own data transmission and emotive projection through the prime Symphony, the Arborec have never developed any form of visual or auditory communication (concepts which, to this day, remain foreign to them).
  
  Arborec scientists found the solution to this dilemma in the Sol merchant vessel Dies Opulen. The crew of the Dies Opulen had tragically become infected by Yborin Plague on Maaluk and had later died in deep space. When the derelict ship was found by an Arborec scout, it was determined the cool bodies of the human crew were in perfect condition for an ambitious experiment. The bodies were sent to the great laboratories in Kushin, near the Arborec capital Phara.
  
  Here, fungal Arzuga cells were attached to the brainstems of the dead humans. It was hoped, when grown under proper conditions, the complex acidic properties of Arzuga would successfully merge the cells with the innate brain-tissue of the deceased subjects, slowly re stimulating the neural pathways back to life. Then, by injecting photo-voltaic stims into the soft tissues of the dead body, the neurally active Arzuga would spur the soft tissue cells to heal and regrow, effectively reanimating the dead body. Symbiotically attached to the host body, the Arzuga fungi evolved into a new being, one which the Arborec call the Dirzuga.
  
  The Dirzuga were the missing link between the Symphony and the manifestation of physical communication that the Arborec lacked. Over the following few decades, the Arborec eagerly acquired additional subjects (human bodies seem to work best and are the most frequently used, but Letnev, Winnu, and Xxcha bodies are also commonly used as Dirzuga hosts), establishing a sizable diplomatic and trading corps that have become the basis for the Arborec’s interaction with the rest of the galaxy.
The Arborec insist the host bodies of the Dirzuga are devoid of the expired individuals’ consciousness. With a cultural relationship to death rooted in the natural cycle of decomposition and regrowth, the Arborec have little understanding or sympathy for those who vigorously protest against the bodies of their citizens being reused (some use the term “enslaved”) in such a manner.
  
  Ultimately, despite the objections of the dissident races, the Arborec were admitted as a member of the galactic council. The potential wealth of foodstuffs, medicines, and other treasures of Nestphar proved effective in overcoming any objections.
  
  While the Arborec insist that the past knowledge and experiences of Dirzuga bodies do not persist beyond this reanimation, there are some who suspect the Arborec do not tell the entire truth. Such theorists can provide many examples in which the Arborec seem to have come upon information, or intimate understanding of other cultures, that seem inexplicable otherwise.

## Xxcha (TI1)

  Bathed in the stong, yet gentle light of the Xxllak star lies the splendid jewel of Archon Ren. A magnificent sylvan planet hosting a vast myriad of living creatures. The Xxcha, a sentient lizard race, are masters of life in Archon Ren and have been considered as one of the Great Galactic Races longer than history itself. The Xxcha people is ruled by the High King and his royals from the mightty city of Kklaj. Here the king oversees a philosophic and peaceful race whose structures and starships are intricately beatuful and an aesthetic joy to the eye. A favorite past time of the elder Xxcha is to contemplate origin and meaning while smoking Gerr-Root from long-stemmed pipes. Tourists find Archon Ren a paradise, and remarkably free of from the annoyance of insects that so often tend to make forest-planets unbearable.
  
  The everlasting sorrow of the gentle Xxcha hover above them in the night sky. Archon Tau, sister planet that once matched Archon Rens beauty and majesty. The ecology of Archon Tau was destroyed in the gruesome bombardment when a Letnev Force invaded and was subsequently defeated by forces from Sol in the early Twilight Years. Once a people with no military, the Xxcha are docile no more. The silent reminder in their night sky keep the Xxcha fleet vigilant and its military determined to never again submit to an invading force.
